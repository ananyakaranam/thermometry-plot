# thermometry-plot

In order to use the Jupyter notebook "Thermometry Plot" to plot your own temperature data, clone this repository and open the notebook inside of the Jupyter Docker container. You will also need to upload your own directory of g3 files (in place of the "cooldown" data directory) to read out and plot. 

To set up the Docker container, follow this demo: https://github.com/simonsobs/ocs-f2f-demo.
